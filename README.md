# Flowcharts & Tables: Algorithms Using `for` Loops

## Program 1: Counting Distance
Write a program, `miles.py`, that outputs values for kilometres and equivalent miles every 10 km up to 100 km. No input is required, but runtime output should look like this:

```
10 km = 6.25 miles
20 km = 12.5 miles
30 km = 18.75 miles
40 km = 25.0 miles
50 km = 31.25 miles
60 km = 37.5 miles
70 km = 43.75 miles
80 km = 50.0 miles
90 km = 56.25 miles
100 km = 62.5 miles
```

## Program 2: Calculating Totals
Write a program, `sum.py`, that takes an input number `n`, and calculates the sum of numbers from `1 to n` using an accumulator variable. Sample runtime should look like:

```
Enter a number: 5

Sum of numbers from 1 to 5: 15
```

## Program 3: Factorials
Write a program, `factorial.py`, that asks the user to input a number `n`, then calculates and outputs the factorial value `n!` Do not use any built-in math functions to calculate this value. Instead, do it iteratively and manually, for example:

$$5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$$

Sample runtime should look like this:

```
Enter a number: 5

5! = 120
```
